# LBYCPA2 @ Data Structures and Algorithms Programming

This lab course is designed to teach undergraduate students about data structures and algorithms programming. The course covers a range of topics from Stack to Graphs and Bubble Sort to QuickSort. Students will gain hands-on experience in implementing and analyzing various data structures and algorithms using programming languages such as C++, Java, and Python.

The course is divided into several modules, each focusing on a different topic in data structures and algorithms. Students will learn how to design and implement different types of data structures, such as linked lists, trees, and hash tables, and how to apply various algorithms to solve common problems, such as sorting and searching.

In addition to theory and practical implementation, the course emphasizes the importance of analyzing the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity. Students will also work with real-world datasets to solve practical problems, such as image processing, natural language processing, and machine learning.

By the end of the course, students will have developed a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms programming and will be equipped with the skills to apply this knowledge to solve a wide range of real-world problems.
